# YC TOP

**yc-top** is a cli project i wrote as a part of my experimentation with the Elm architecture and functional programming.
Its a simple CLI tool written in **Go** using **BubbleTea** TUI framework. A simple TUI app that lets you browse top stories from Hacker News.

## What Can It Do

- View the top stories on Hacker News.
- Navigate through the list with your keyboard.
